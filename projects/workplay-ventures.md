While working with Zynga games family house Workplay Ventures,  I lead prototyping a card game Dapp for them. the card game was supposed to be a simple trading card game on the Ethereum blockchain.  
        This was accomplished by writing a smart contract that released ERC20 tokens, taking a name, symbol, number of decimals, and number of tokens to be minted as arguments.  
        Once cards were minted they would be available for purchase in a market where a user could buy a card with ethereum and them see the card in their wallet based on their public wallet address. 
        Although Zynga never brought this prototype to market, the success of some similar card games like [cryptokitties.co](cryptokitties.co), [mlbcryptobaseball.com](mlbcryptobaseball.com) and [godsunchained.com](godsunchained.com) all had great success with extremely similar concepts
