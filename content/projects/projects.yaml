#   desc: "While working with Zynga games family house Workplay Ventures,  I led prototyping a card game Dapp. The card game was intended to be a simple trading card game on the Ethereum blockchain.  
#         This was accomplished by writing a smart contract that released ERC20 tokens, taking a name, symbol, number of decimals, and number of tokens, to be minted as arguments.  
#         Once cards were minted they would be available for purchase in a market where a user could buy a card with ethereum and then see the card in their wallet based on their public wallet address. 
#         Although Zynga never brought this prototype to market, the success of some similar card games like cryptokitties.co , mlbcryptobaseball.com and godsunchained.com 
#         all had great success with extremely similar concepts."

    The app uses QR codes to assign point rewards based on select activities: class attendance, bringing a friend, purchasing merchandise or sharing a status on social media. We were intentional in 
    our use of the QR codes as a solution that offered studio owners the most control over how participation was validated.
    The Pure Barre app was downloaded over ~30K times, doubling forecasted numbers and had a user base of ~65K. We were also successful at extending the average time spent visiting the 
    app to 1.5 minutes, which far exceeded website visits."
